## Introduction
While my background is primarily working with either Oracle or T-SQL databases, MySQL is also an important variant.  It is also open source and I'm in a "use it or lose it" position.  So, to keep my query syntax relatively fresh, I've loaded MySQL onto my machine and am working with some datasets to generate queries.

## Introduction
While my background is primarily working with either Oracle or T-SQL databases, MySQL is also an important variant.  

I was asked to build some simple queries, for a technical interview.  This outlines the process I went through to 

1)  Identify and download an important open source database for a Windows 10 machine
2)  Build and then start a database instance
3)  Build tables in the new database
4)  Add data to the new tables
5)  And then I will check my answers for my rough draft queries and put the correct answer down, if I find errors.

### Download the database software

I downloaded MySQL for Windows from the following site:
[http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html)

and executed the mysql-installer-web-community-5.7.10.0.msi which opened up the MySQL Workbench.  I poked around a bit and figured out the gui as well as the CLI interface for MySQL 5.7.  I was then confident to begin building a database.  


### Create a database
I'll be loading most of my tables in a new database.  If / when I figure out what further work I might do, would drive the schema build, but for the purpose of this small project, I'm just building one and will be throwing a variety of tables in there to test various queries against it.

```MySQL
create database PerfDat;
```

### Build tables

I was given two tables to work with in the assignment.


**SiteRatingsEvents**

Site ID   |     Quality Rating	|Rating Type	                |Date Rating Received
----------|---------------------|-------------------------------|------
27376	  |      2	        |Initial Rating	                |3/12/2014
27376	  |      3	        |Deficiency Area Re-Rating	|11/12/2014
54415     |	 2	        |Initial Rating	                |6/27/2014


*and*


**SiteStatus**

Site ID        |Active
---------------|-------
27376	       | Yes
54415	       | No


```MySQL
create table SiteRatingsEvents (
Site_ID int,
Quality_Rating int,
Rating_Type varchar(150),
Date_Rating_Received datetime
)


create table SiteStatus (
Site_ID int,
Active varchar(3)
)
```

### Load the example data into the tables
For another data set and another block of analytics I'll be playing with, I found that the MySQL load wizard was much too slow for the 351,981 rows of information with its 21 columns.  So, I used the following command and loaded that into a SysDat table (not shown in the create table above) and the load was very quick.  The caveats are that the file was .txt because I did have a char field which had commas in it.  I moved my file to the temp directory instead of trying to play with loose references.  
```MySQL
LOAD DATA INFILE '/Temp/sysdat.txt' INTO TABLE SystemData;
```
For the two tiny tables above, I just used the syntax available to load 

```sql

INSERT INTO `perfdat`.`siteratingsevents` 
(`Site_ID`,
`Quality_Rating`,
`Rating_Type`,
`Date_Rating_Received`)
VALUES
(27376,
2,
'Initial Rating',
'2014-3-12'),
(27376,
33,
'Deficiency Area Re-Rating',
'2014-11-12'),
(54415,
2,
'Initial Rating',
'2014-6-27')
```
One of the interesting syntax points which caught me was the use of the (`) character instead of the single quote (').  I had to use the forward single quote to get the fields properly identified and separated for a char datatype.

```sql
INSERT INTO perfdat.sitestatus
(`Site_id`, `Active`) 
VALUES
(27376,'Yes'),
(54415,'No')
```

###Question #1
>To begin with the client would like to know the number of sites that have completed a rating event? Please show us what SQL query you would write to return this information.
```sql
select count(distinct site_id) as site_completed
from siteratingsevents
where Quality_Rating is not null
```
site_completed
--------------
2

###Question #2
>The client now informs you that some of the sites that had been rated have now dropped out of the program. They provide you with the following table (SiteStatus). They would like to know how many active sites have completed the rating process? 

MySQL does not support the WITH statement - what I returned in my response, so I'll need to rework the query.

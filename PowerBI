I was asked to create a visualization using PowerBI.  I have to say I am unimpressed with this tool.  It lacks the flexibility found in Excel or PowerPoint, or with SQL Services Reporting, among other Microsoft products.  However, this two page demonstration of charting and mapping was created in less than 30 minutes from unzipping the software to playing with what little formatting functions were available.

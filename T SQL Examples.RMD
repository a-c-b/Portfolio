I primarily used T-SQL to join multiple databases together as dblink authority was restricted based upon database - to - database connections.  My workgroup, as a national core reporting organization, had access to multiple dbs which might have granted access to each other.  We used our development server to cross the platforms in prep to send the final t-sql code to the reporting group.

Originally, I was using stored procedures not just to pull data from one production database into the development server, but also creating & updating interim views or tables within that same stored procedure.  I changed this direction when I realized that [documenting the code](https://github.com/andrea345/Portfolio/blob/master/Documenting_Metric_Code.RMD) in the stored procedures was more difficult "to reach," than simply pulling the data into Views.  SQL Server system tables "documented" the view code the same way Oracle databases did.  So, I moved any code or logic which was something other than a direct call to a view in another database to SQL Server Views to ensure I could capture all logic and code which "changed" anything.

By using "OpenQuery" syntax, I was able to manage some more complex query structure in my "higher" end databases - things like an ErlangB package / calculator.  However, one of the big problems I ran into with OpenQuery is the 8,000 character limit.  So, even while I was trying to migrate some of my more complex code into the MS SQL Server database, I ended up having to rewrite huge chunks of logic and break apart views I'd written in Oracle which exceeded 8,000 characters.  

This forced me to change my logic about what I should and how I should bring in data to the development server.  It also forced me into a small amount of database administration.

Below  are some small applications I wrote using Visual Basic which pulled, parsed, and created final reports from raw data logfiles.  Most of the ETL I did captured capital equipment configuration.  

My process for collecting the data was commonly:

1.  I would write scripts in Reflections or ReflectionsX which would open a TCP/IP session to a TTY port of a node.
2.  Open a log file
3.  Execute a single MML command against the node.
4.  Close the logfile when a specific flag is detected.  Then either
  1. Open a new logfile and execute another MML command and close the new logfile OR
  2. exit the Node and move to the next node.

The logfiles were resident on a specific drive in a specific directory and then the macros were executed against specific file names from there.  

This is how I managed data wrangling in the past.  There were many data sets which had to be pulled, cleaned, parsed and then joined together to create a logical output.  As network complexity grew, what used to take 3 commands to be executed for a continuous path check for availability, grew to over 26.  Capital equipment which was not fully defined would be and often was "lost" to allocation because of this specific problem of missing configuration data. 

I have other, more complex macros available upon request.

## Macro 1
The steps in this first macro
1.  Opened a new workbook, import the data in columnar format, and renamed the worksheet.  
2.  The next arranged the columns in a specific order.  
3.  Cleared flag lines.  
4.  Operated on one of the numeric fields and removed odd numbered processors if there was a "twin" condition (i.e., stand-by)
5.  Removed double blank rows.
6.  Renamed the file per instruction.
